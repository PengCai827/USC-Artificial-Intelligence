# USC-Artificial-Intelligence
1. Overview [100 Points]:
Bayesian Networks, also called Belief or Causal Networks, are a part of probability theory and are important for reasoning in AI. They are a powerful tool for modeling decision-making under uncertainty. In this assignment you will implement code for computing inferences in Bayesian networks of discrete random variables.
You are a newly hired AI specialist at a large urban hospital. The hospital management has heard about the recent advances in AI technology and would like to see if it could be used in context of the hospital. In particular, management is interested in seeing AI approaches could be used to help doctors make more correct diagnoses.
The hospital already has a fairly extensive electronic medical record system, and they know for various diseases, what the priori probability of the diseases, P(D). In addition, they have also been able to determine the probability of various lab results, given one of the particular diseases P(F | D). You can assume that these probabilities are conditionally independent. The lab results, also called Findings, are binary random variables, that is, they are either present(true) or absent(false). Because some of the lab results are very expensive and others take a while to run, not all patients have all results available.
